# Diffused

A vulnerability scan diffing tool for container images and SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials). Diffused helps track security improvements and regressions between different versions of container images by comparing SBOMs vulnerability scan results from SBOMs.

Its name comes from the pun `diff + used`, which means it performs the diffing of both results.

## Features

- üîç **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning of SBOMs using [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/)
- üìä **SBOM Diffing**: Direct comparison of SPDX-JSON formatted SBOMs
- üìÑ **Multiple Output Formats**: Support for both rich text and JSON output

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Trivy**: Follow the [official Trivy installation guide](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/getting-started/installation/)
2. **Python Environment**: Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed

### Installation

#### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konflux-ci/diffused.git
cd diffused
pip install -e .
```

### Usage

#### Compare Container Images

```bash
# Basic vulnerability diff between two container images
diffused image-diff -p ubuntu:20.04 -n ubuntu:22.04

# Get detailed information about each vulnerability
diffused image-diff -p nginx:1.20 -n nginx:1.21 --all-info

# Save output to JSON file
diffused image-diff -p app:v1.0 -n app:v2.0 --output json --file report.json
```

#### Compare SBOMs

```bash
# Compare two SBOM files
diffused sbom-diff -p previous.json -n current.json

# Get detailed vulnerability information
diffused sbom-diff -p old-sbom.json -n new-sbom.json --all-info

# Export to file with rich formatting
diffused sbom-diff -p v1-sbom.json -n v2-sbom.json --file vulnerability-report.txt
```
